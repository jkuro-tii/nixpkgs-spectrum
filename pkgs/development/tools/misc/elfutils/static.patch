+1 Notes on the Free Translation Project
+***************************************
+
+Free software is going international!  The Free Translation Project is a
+way to get maintainers of free software, translators, and users all
+together, so that free software will gradually become able to speak many
+languages.  A few packages already provide translations for their
+messages.
+
+   If you found this 'ABOUT-NLS' file inside a distribution, you may
+assume that the distributed package does use GNU 'gettext' internally,
+itself available at your nearest GNU archive site.  But you do _not_
+need to install GNU 'gettext' prior to configuring, installing or using
+this package with messages translated.
+
+   Installers will find here some useful hints.  These notes also
+explain how users should proceed for getting the programs to use the
+available translations.  They tell how people wanting to contribute and
+work on translations can contact the appropriate team.
+
+1.1 INSTALL Matters
+===================
+
+Some packages are "localizable" when properly installed; the programs
+they contain can be made to speak your own native language.  Most such
+packages use GNU 'gettext'.  Other packages have their own ways to
+internationalization, predating GNU 'gettext'.
+
+   By default, this package will be installed to allow translation of
+messages.  It will automatically detect whether the system already
+provides the GNU 'gettext' functions.  Installers may use special
+options at configuration time for changing the default behaviour.  The
+command:
+
+     ./configure --disable-nls
+
+will _totally_ disable translation of messages.
+
+   When you already have GNU 'gettext' installed on your system and run
+configure without an option for your new package, 'configure' will
+probably detect the previously built and installed 'libintl' library and
+will decide to use it.  If not, you may have to to use the
+'--with-libintl-prefix' option to tell 'configure' where to look for it.
+
+   Internationalized packages usually have many 'po/LL.po' files, where
+LL gives an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying the language.  Unless
+translations have been forbidden at 'configure' time by using the
+'--disable-nls' switch, all available translations are installed
+together with the package.  However, the environment variable 'LINGUAS'
+may be set, prior to configuration, to limit the installed set.
+'LINGUAS' should then contain a space separated list of two-letter
+codes, stating which languages are allowed.
+
+1.2 Using This Package
+======================
+
+As a user, if your language has been installed for this package, you
+only have to set the 'LANG' environment variable to the appropriate
+'LL_CC' combination.  If you happen to have the 'LC_ALL' or some other
+'LC_xxx' environment variables set, you should unset them before setting
+'LANG', otherwise the setting of 'LANG' will not have the desired
+effect.  Here 'LL' is an ISO 639 two-letter language code, and 'CC' is
+an ISO 3166 two-letter country code.  For example, let's suppose that
+you speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell prompt, merely
+execute 'setenv LANG de_DE' (in 'csh'), 'export LANG; LANG=de_DE' (in
+'sh') or 'export LANG=de_DE' (in 'bash').  This can be done from your
+'.login' or '.profile' file, once and for all.
+
+   You might think that the country code specification is redundant.
+But in fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For
+example, 'de_AT' is used for Austria, and 'pt_BR' for Brazil.  The
+country code serves to distinguish the dialects.
+
+   The locale naming convention of 'LL_CC', with 'LL' denoting the
+language and 'CC' denoting the country, is the one use on systems based
+on GNU libc.  On other systems, some variations of this scheme are used,
+such as 'LL' or 'LL_CC.ENCODING'.  You can get the list of locales
+supported by your system for your language by running the command
+'locale -a | grep '^LL''.
+
+   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an
+English message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you
+understand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.
+This is done through a different environment variable, called
+'LANGUAGE'.  GNU 'gettext' gives preference to 'LANGUAGE' over 'LANG'
+for the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have 'LANG'
+set to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the
+system libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather read
+translations in German than English for when Swedish is not available,
+set 'LANGUAGE' to 'sv:de' while leaving 'LANG' to 'sv_SE'.
+
+   Special advice for Norwegian users: The language code for Norwegian
+bokma*l changed from 'no' to 'nb' recently (in 2003).  During the
+transition period, while some message catalogs for this language are
+installed under 'nb' and some older ones under 'no', it's recommended
+for Norwegian users to set 'LANGUAGE' to 'nb:no' so that both newer and
+older translations are used.
+
+   In the 'LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the 'LANG'
+environment variable, 'LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as 'LL' to
+denote the language's main dialect.  For example, 'de' is equivalent to
+'de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and 'pt' to 'pt_PT' (Portuguese
+as spoken in Portugal) in this context.
+
+1.3 Translating Teams
+=====================
+
+For the Free Translation Project to be a success, we need interested
+people who like their own language and write it well, and who are also
+able to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.
+Each translation team has its own mailing list.  The up-to-date list of
+teams can be found at the Free Translation Project's homepage,
+'http://translationproject.org/', in the "Teams" area.
+
+   If you'd like to volunteer to _work_ at translating messages, you
+should become a member of the translating team for your own language.
+The subscribing address is _not_ the same as the list itself, it has
+'-request' appended.  For example, speakers of Swedish can send a
+message to 'sv-request@li.org', having this message body:
+
+     subscribe
+
+   Keep in mind that team members are expected to participate _actively_
+in translations, or at solving translational difficulties, rather than
+merely lurking around.  If your team does not exist yet and you want to
+start one, or if you are unsure about what to do or how to get started,
+please write to 'coordinator@translationproject.org' to reach the
+coordinator for all translator teams.
+
+   The English team is special.  It works at improving and uniformizing
+the terminology in use.  Proven linguistic skills are praised more than
+programming skills, here.
+
+1.4 Available Packages
+======================
+
+Languages are not equally supported in all packages.  The following
+matrix shows the current state of internationalization, as of Jun 2014.
+The matrix shows, in regard of each package, for which languages PO
+files have been submitted to translation coordination, with a
+translation percentage of at least 50%.

+   Some counters in the preceding matrix are higher than the number of
+visible blocks let us expect.  This is because a few extra PO files are
+used for implementing regional variants of languages, or language
+dialects.
+
+   For a PO file in the matrix above to be effective, the package to
+which it applies should also have been internationalized and distributed
+as such by its maintainer.  There might be an observable lag between the
+mere existence a PO file and its wide availability in a distribution.
+
+   If Jun 2014 seems to be old, you may fetch a more recent copy of this
+'ABOUT-NLS' file on most GNU archive sites.  The most up-to-date matrix
+with full percentage details can be found at
+'http://translationproject.org/extra/matrix.html'.
+
+1.5 Using 'gettext' in new packages
+===================================
+
+If you are writing a freely available program and want to
+internationalize it you are welcome to use GNU 'gettext' in your
+package.  Of course you have to respect the GNU Lesser General Public
+License which covers the use of the GNU 'gettext' library.  This means
+in particular that even non-free programs can use 'libintl' as a shared
+library, whereas only free software can use 'libintl' as a static
+library or use modified versions of 'libintl'.
+
+   Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle
+the use of 'gettext' the only thing missing are the translations.  The
+Free Translation Project is also available for packages which are not
+developed inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above
+applies also for every other Free Software Project.  Contact
+'coordinator@translationproject.org' to make the '.pot' files available
+to the translation teams.

+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']

+                          @<:@PREFIX@:>@
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.

+\`configure' configures elfutils 0.187 to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:

+                          @<:@PREFIX@:>@
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.

+   Suppress extern inline (with or without __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)))
+   on configurations that mistakenly use 'static inline' to implement
+   functions or macros in standard C headers like <ctype.h>.  For example,
+   if isdigit is mistakenly implemented via a static inline function,
+   a program containing an extern inline function that calls isdigit
+   may not work since the C standard prohibits extern inline functions
+   from calling static functions.  This bug is known to occur on:
+
+     OS X 10.8 and earlier; see:
+     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html
+
+     DragonFly; see
+     http://muscles.dragonflybsd.org/bulk/bleeding-edge-potential/latest-per-pkg/ah-tty-0.3.12.log
+
+     FreeBSD; see:
+     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2014-07/msg00104.html
+
+   OS X 10.9 has a macro __header_inline indicating the bug is fixed for C and
+   for clang but remains for g++; see <http://trac.macports.org/ticket/41033>.
+   Assume DragonFly and FreeBSD will be similar.  */

+
+   Suppress extern inline with HP-UX cc, as it appears to be broken; see
+   <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-texinfo/2013-02/msg00030.html>.
+
+   Suppress extern inline with Sun C in standards-conformance mode, as it
+   mishandles inline functions that call each other.  E.g., for 'inline void f
+   (void) { } inline void g (void) { f (); }', c99 incorrectly complains
+   'reference to static identifier "f" in extern inline function'.
+   This bug was observed with Sun C 5.12 SunOS_i386 2011/11/16.
+
+   Suppress extern inline (with or without __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)))
+   on configurations that mistakenly use 'static inline' to implement
+   functions or macros in standard C headers like <ctype.h>.  For example,
+   if isdigit is mistakenly implemented via a static inline function,
+   a program containing an extern inline function that calls isdigit
+   may not work since the C standard prohibits extern inline functions
+   from calling static functions.  This bug is known to occur on:
+
+     OS X 10.8 and earlier; see:
+     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html
+
+     DragonFly; see
+     http://muscles.dragonflybsd.org/bulk/bleeding-edge-potential/latest-per-pkg/ah-tty-0.3.12.log
+
+     FreeBSD; see:
+     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2014-07/msg00104.html
+
+   OS X 10.9 has a macro __header_inline indicating the bug is fixed for C and
+   for clang but remains for g++; see <http://trac.macports.org/ticket/41033>.
+   Assume DragonFly and FreeBSD will be similar.  */

+dnl gl_THREADLIB
+dnl ------------
+dnl Tests for a multithreading library to be used.
+dnl If the configure.ac contains a definition of the gl_THREADLIB_DEFAULT_NO
+dnl (it must be placed before the invocation of gl_THREADLIB_EARLY!), then the
+dnl default is 'no', otherwise it is system dependent. In both cases, the user
+dnl can change the choice through the options --enable-threads=choice or
+dnl --disable-threads.
+dnl Defines at most one of the macros USE_POSIX_THREADS, USE_SOLARIS_THREADS,
+dnl USE_PTH_THREADS, USE_WINDOWS_THREADS
+dnl Sets the variables LIBTHREAD and LTLIBTHREAD to the linker options for use
+dnl in a Makefile (LIBTHREAD for use without libtool, LTLIBTHREAD for use with
+dnl libtool).
+dnl Sets the variables LIBMULTITHREAD and LTLIBMULTITHREAD similarly, for
+dnl programs that really need multithread functionality. The difference
+dnl between LIBTHREAD and LIBMULTITHREAD is that on platforms supporting weak
+dnl symbols, typically LIBTHREAD is empty whereas LIBMULTITHREAD is not.
+dnl Adds to CPPFLAGS the flag -D_REENTRANT or -D_THREAD_SAFE if needed for
+dnl multithread-safe programs.
